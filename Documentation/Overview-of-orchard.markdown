Orchard CMS - it's not exactly Content Management System. It is rather a Content Management Framework - 
the basis for your niche CMS.  

Orchard may be well expanded by the expense of the modules.Module Orchard CMS can contain anything from JavaScript-file 
that you can use on the site, to the CMS extensions and ASP.NET MVC Area.  
Orchard CMS developers instead of creating a large and flexible system, made it small but very extensible.  
The Orchard CMS is not observed backward compatibility. So the modules from Orchard 1.3 can not work with version 1.4.  

Orchard CMS - is an Open Source-project. So you can always look with a debugger what is wrong, 
go to the project website and see if your problem is in the list of bugs.  
It is worth mentioning that the developers of Orchard CMS well respond to the questions on 
[Stackoverflow.com](Stackoverflow.com) and [orchard.codeplex.com](http://orchard.codeplex.com/discussions)
